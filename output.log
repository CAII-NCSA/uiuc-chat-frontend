Please use our support portal to fill out a proposal, or ask questions.\nBelow are some of the projects that our collaborators have done.\n\narXiv Bibliographic Explorer\n\nBibliographic Explorer code repository\nCollaborators: Matt Bierbaum, Cornell Computing and Information Science\narXiv Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. The primary objective of the project is to enable discovery of relevant research and context by providing user-friendly navigation of an article\'s citation tree.\n\nar5iv\n\nar5iv code repository\nCollaborators: Michael Kohlhase and Deyan Ginev from Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Bruce Miller from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Ben Firschman from arXiv-Vanity.\nOur top priority is to provide a high-quality service to all arXiv authors and readers. The overarching objective of this project is to significantly improve the usability and accessibility of arXiv papers. While providing HTML is not a panacea, it is a first step in the right direction.\n\nCORE recommender\n\nCORE Recommender arXiv paper, Research outputs by CORE\nCollaborators: CORE Team\nExplore relevant open access papers from across a global network of research repositories while browsing arXiv. Research papers are recommended from both arXiv and other over 10 thousand open access data providers and brought to you by CORE, the world’s largest aggregator of open access research.\n\narXiv Links to Code & Data\n\nLinks to Code repository\nCollaborators: Robert Stojnic, Viktor Kerkez, and Ludovic Viaud, from Papers with Code / Meta AI Research\narXiv Links to Code & Data aims to provide an easy and convenient way to find relevant code for a paper. It is using data from  Papers with Code - a free resource that links papers, code and results in Machine Learning. Papers with Code is the biggest such resource and is licensed under an open license.\n\nConnected Papers\n---\n12: The Stack Overflow Blog\nThe Stack Overflow Blog - Stack Overflow\n\n\nNow please respond to my query: Make a bullet point list of key takeaways of the course.'

Please use our support portal to fill out a proposal, or ask questions.\nBelow are some of the projects that our collaborators have done.\n\narXiv Bibliographic Explorer\n\nBibliographic Explorer code repository\nCollaborators: Matt Bierbaum, Cornell Computing and Information Science\narXiv Bibliographic Explorer displays information about works that cite and are cited by arXiv papers and their published versions. The primary objective of the project is to enable discovery of relevant research and context by providing user-friendly navigation of an article\'s citation tree.\n\nar5iv\n\nar5iv code repository\nCollaborators: Michael Kohlhase and Deyan Ginev from Friedrich-Alexander Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Bruce Miller from National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and Ben Firschman from arXiv-Vanity.\nOur top priority is to provide a high-quality service to all arXiv authors and readers. The overarching objective of this project is to significantly improve the usability and accessibility of arXiv papers. While providing HTML is not a panacea, it is a first step in the right direction.\n\nCORE recommender\n\nCORE Recommender arXiv paper, Research outputs by CORE\nCollaborators: CORE Team\nExplore relevant open access papers from across a global network of research repositories while browsing arXiv. Research papers are recommended from both arXiv and other over 10 thousand open access data providers and brought to you by CORE, the world’s largest aggregator of open access research.\n\narXiv Links to Code & Data\n\nLinks to Code repository\nCollaborators: Robert Stojnic, Viktor Kerkez, and Ludovic Viaud, from Papers with Code / Meta AI Research\narXiv Links to Code & Data aims to provide an easy and convenient way to find relevant code for a paper. It is using data from  Papers with Code - a free resource that links papers, code and results in Machine Learning. Papers with Code is the biggest such resource and is licensed under an open license.\n\nConnected Papers',
